HELLO!
This is a basic Minecraft clone, with the following features;
A variety of blocks to place,
Monsters and an attack/health system,
And combat.

It may create a file called gamelog.log, this is just a text file showing the game log.
You can also save worlds, a worldsave.json file should appear in the main DIR the script is running on.
Simply click "load world" in the game menu, and it should find your worldsave.json file.

You can summon experimental mobs by pressing "M" and "B".
The "B" type mob has no texture. This is normal, and is a bug I might later fix.
